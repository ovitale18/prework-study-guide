# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I wanted to create a comprehensive studyguide to store information I learned throughout my bootcamp prework.  I built this project so that I would have somewhere to look back and review all the things I learned. I learned a lot about Github and how I'm going to be using that program inmy upcoming course as well as a lot about basic coding. I am very much looking forwqard to branching out on all these new topics!

You can use this prework studyguide to review things i learned during prework. Hopefully my notes come in handy during the actual course. There are seperate sections for each of the topics we've covered so far including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
